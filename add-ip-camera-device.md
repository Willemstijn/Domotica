# Adding a IP camera to Domoticz
In this example I will add a YCC365 IP camera to Domoticz.  
First configure the device as a local device (reset and connect to the device with it's local Wifi hotspot. Then login with the app with 'admin' password '12345'). Set a new admin password.  
Then connect the camera to the local network according to the instructions given (QR code generated by the App).  
If this is finished, you can add the IP camera to Domoticz with the following steps:

0. Determine the IP address of the camera (on my DHCP server it was detected as the 'ipc' device).   
Check the MAC address of the device (with the App) with the MAC of the DHCP lease.
1. Open Domoticz and go to 'Setup > More options > Cameras'.
2. Click on the 'add camera' button upper right.
3. For an actual list of ImageURLs for IP cameras you can go to [Domoticz IP Camera's page](https://www.domoticz.com/wiki/Hardware#IP-networkcameras)
4. Another source for IP camera setups can be found on [iSpyConnect](http://www.ispyconnect.com/sources.aspx), [YCC BBS](https://bbs.ycc365plus.com/) or the [ycc365 plus faq](https://www.ycc365plus.com/en/category/faq)
5.  Another source for configuration is the [Onvif software](https://sourceforge.net/projects/onvifdm/)
6. The iSpy website generates the setup for the YCC camera as follows: rtsp://<ip-address>:554/. My configuration appeares to be: rtsp://192.168.88.238:554/. User 'admin' and no password strangely enough.
The final configuation for streaming appeared to be rtsp://admin@192.168.88.238:554/

A section from the YCC 365 plus faq:
```
RTSP stands for real-time stream protocol, itâ€™s the primary multimedia stream protocol enables your cameras to deliver video stream. Almost network cameras rely on this protocol to transmit video/audio stream to web browser/video management software/NVR/NAS.

IP address: DHCP
username: admin
password: 123456 or no password
Port number: HTTP port (80), RTSP port (554), ONVIF port (80).
RTSP URL: rtsp://[username]:[password]@[ip]:[port]
Main stream RTSP: rtsp://admin:123456@192.0.0.64:554
```
rtsp://admin:123456@192.168.88.238:554/
